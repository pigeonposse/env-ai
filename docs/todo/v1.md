# TO DO list for ENV-AI v1

## ðŸŒˆ General

- [ ] Add `llamaindex` and embedings with `nomic-embed-text`. 
    The idea is that you are able to read the entire context of the project and use that data to improve chat responses.
- [ ] In the chat to do that when the user aborts the answer does not leave the entire process but executes another prompt of question for the user.
- [ ] Maybe remove the user prompt from the beginning.
- [ ] That the input and excuse them are not mandatory

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas / future list

- [ ] Add API / Chatweb
